# Arduino_Multitasker
A simple solution for emulating multitasking in Arduino systems is not a full-fledged operating system (there is no context switching), but it allows you to arrange different tasks as separate functions, set their priority, perform these tasks once or cyclically, thereby emulating the parallel execution.
